# 📖 [Github_User_Finder] <a name="about-project"></a>

> This is an application used to fetch github users and their information based on the username. It allows you see their Repo, Followers and much more

This is a fully Functional React app used to fetch github users and informations about the user.
It was done optimized for both Mobile, Tablet and laptop screens
It was completed using React and Tailwind while implementing features such as lazy loading, routing , styling with tailwind css, outlets, error boundaries, react-toastify
and much more.

It challenged me having to come up with design for the app and plan to implement caching with react query later on.
